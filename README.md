# DSP Library

This is a small library of DSP utilities for my own edification. There are implementations of the FFT, STFT, DTWT, and DHT. The code is heavily commented and meant to be understandable moreso than efficient. Hopefully this can help someone understand these tools better!

## Dependencies
To use this package, you'll need

* Numpy
* Numba
* Tdqm

## Installation
Using the terminal, type `pip install {path-to-directory-containing-setup.py}` This package can be removed using `pip uninstall dsplib`

## Usage

Consult each Python file for information on how to use the tools. A familiarity with DSP is assumed.
